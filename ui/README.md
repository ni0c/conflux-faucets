<img width="1792" alt="banner" src="https://conflux-faucets.com/cfx_faucets.jpg">

This is the UI for Conflux Faucets in both Core Space and eSpace.

## Bootstrap

Clone the code from github.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ni0c/conflux-faucets.git
```

## Local testing

Faucets UI is located at `ui` directory of the github repository. 

For testing an online web server is needed for the Google Captcha to work. Google Captcha 
service needs to be registered with the web server address and google account. 

One is able to test the connection with the wallets after captcha is solved. PHP backend is closed source, so 
one cannot test fully, but can test basic functionality of wallet connection and captcha.
